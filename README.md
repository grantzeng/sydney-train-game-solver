Things to do before writing a blog post
- Brute force approach: There's `5 * 4^3 * 4!` possible expressions and why that is the case. Ignore the fact that `*` and `+` are commutative for now.
    - Write brute force solver from scratch (like you were writing it in C; learn something about parse trees)
- Solver considered as a search problem? Matt was trying to solve it with a DFS &mdash; but what exactly does the graph we'd be searching through look like?
- Was it always solvable/is it always solvable in Sydney? Might have to email Simon.
